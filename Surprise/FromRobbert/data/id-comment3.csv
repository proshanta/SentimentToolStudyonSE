"722","Out of curiosity, could we save a FOLLOWING notification as our lastMessage then, even if we don't send it? That would give you the 'current' state more accurately than a stale LOOKING notification and it seems like it could solve this particular problem. We could, but that wouldn't give an accurate state as well. A peer might be in the LOOKING state (next FLE round) while the lastMessage gets sent. There will be race conditions. In my opinion, a better way of doing this is to send the current state instead of lastMessage. In which case, I agree with Flavio that sending the final notifications won't be necessary. This will also reduce the number of notifications exchanged."
