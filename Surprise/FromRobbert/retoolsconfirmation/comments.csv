"154","Marshall, I'm wondering if the bug has something to do with the following: when you create a client, the second parameter to the constructor determines the random seed used by the client. That second parameter I think is supposed to be the client's id, but what is passed is clients.size(). I might be wrong here but I don't see where this vector of clients is cleared in between tests, so is it true that at some point the set size is fixed and all the seeds are the same ?"

"722","Out of curiosity, could we save a FOLLOWING notification as our lastMessage then, even if we don't send it? That would give you the 'current' state more accurately than a stale LOOKING notification and it seems like it could solve this particular problem. We could, but that wouldn't give an accurate state as well. A peer might be in the LOOKING state (next FLE round) while the lastMessage gets sent. There will be race conditions. In my opinion, a better way of doing this is to send the current state instead of lastMessage. In which case, I agree with Flavio that sending the final notifications won't be necessary. This will also reduce the number of notifications exchanged."

"10314","First I want to verify that Gretchen's fix >Additional Comments From Gretchen Chiaramonte 2003-09-22 20:04 ------- for this bug works for me as well using Xalan 2.6.0. Second, regarding: >Additional Comments From Igor Hersht 2003-08-12 22:59 ------- ... >If I recall correctly we had such discussion before. >We consider that as a wrong usage. >The correct method would be to create transformer and >to do multiple transformations like >transformer.transform(xmlSource,outputTarget), >transformer.transform(xmlSource,outputTarget), To help clarify what Gretchen has already implied, I believe that this doesn't complete the story. Xalan currently fails unneccessarily if 'xmlSource' is an XMLFilter chain headed by an XML source The XMLFilter chain should be reusable with only the source is refreshed. But at the end of the TransformerImpl.transformNode() call, the DTMManager is erased by the call to XPathContext.reset() as cited by Gretchen. This manager is what binds the XMLFilter to e.g. its stylesheet. Therefore, until this bug is repaired, the filter chain cannot be reused. That's a shame because I suspect that setting up the filter chain (eg reading the stylesheet from disk) is more work than constructing the transformer. In case it isn't obvious, a workaround re-creates the XMLFilter chain each time is it transformed. I did not find this bug report at first. Sorting out why I was getting a NullPointerException was a lot of work, partly because Xalan is built in to the JDK runtime but the 'endorsed' jar files are stored in common/endorsed under tomcat rather than JDK's endorsed (surprise ,-). In addition, Xalan has another bug in DTMManagerDefault.getDTM() (incorrectly returns the null this thread discusses) and one in TransformerImpl.run() (inappropriate throw calls). I will enter these as new bugs."

Since jar is pretty much invisible at runtime maybe we can have some version marker inside package, and then version in the URL can be at the level, so all other relative URLs inside package would work fine below that level.

But the issue is that, I might be having 50 or even 500 multi select boxes in my application depending upon the records in my database. If I implement reset method, I dont want to iterate each check box and reset it to a default value. Is there any way to reset all the multi select boxes to a default value, in one shot. As per your suggestion, I need to get the request parameters and compare their values with those of the multi select box selected options and reset it accordingly? My question here is, multi-selectbox A(String[]) is having a default value null. Once data is loaded from database A's value is {x,y}. If user unselects both the x and y in browser for this multi-select box then it is still showing the {x,y} in my Action class when I pass the values back to database. what I'm expecting is a null value for A. Please let me know how to resolve this. Thanks and Regards, Sreedhar. http://issues.apache.org/struts/browse/STR-2927?page=comments#action_37962 ] the request only if the checkbox/select is selected. If you dont unselect it, you wont get the key=value in your request. method of the ActionForm, reset the value for the array i.e. retaining previous values if none is selected. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------- URL: http://issues.apache.org/struts/browse/STR-2927 Struts 1 Affects Versions: 1.2 Family is the HTML for my element. size='3' ><option value='1'>ABC</option> selected='selected'>DEF</option> <option value='6' selected='selected'>JKL</option> value='9'>MNO</option> selected='selected'>VWX</option> selected='selected'>YZA</option> <option value='1111'>FFFFF</option> <option value='209'>TQPN</option> </select> database. If I re-visit the application and deselect all the options selected in this box, it is not reflecting to show empty list. I'm using a string array in my form bean to hold these values. the String array should be empty or null. But it is still holding the previous set of values. any other action(selecting other values or deselecting one or more by keeping atleast one value selected) it works fine. automatically generated by JIRA. contact one of the administrators: http://issues.apache.org/struts/secure/Administrators.jspa information on JIRA, see: http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira"

If you want to send over the trace I can take a look and see if I can see anything out of the ordinary.

I am testing the samples provided. The syncpingclient works fine (after a few updates) in W-RM 1.0 but not for WS-RM 1.1. When using WS-RM 1.1,Ã¥ÃŠ the anonymous replyTo is not understood as such and is treated as an actual URL. When a CreateSequence message is sent, the response is of course never received, with an UnknownHostException. The debug log looks fine, in that the correct processing seems to take place. What am I missing ? Your help will be greatly appreciated.
